First, it is a low-frequency component, as it is a bigger component but more efficient than the other two. Additionally, it introduces less \"noise\" into the system as a whole. The documentation for it is quite good. Its max input voltage is quite high, meaning that if a group member needs to use a higher voltage throughout the system, my subsystem won't need to see any changes. The 1 amp it provides is more than enough. Lastly, this is the surface-mount model of the switching regulator we used in EGR 314, making its setup quite familiar.</p>"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#sensor","title":"Sensor","text":"<ol> <li>ICP-20100</li> </ol> <p>\u00b7 $2.92 \u00b7 Link to product \u00b7 $14.00 \u00b7 Link to breakout board</p> Pros Cons Breakout board, so foot footprint is small on pcb Needs the breakout board; otherwise, soldering is too hard Offers I2c, I3c, and spi options Good documentation <ol> <li>ICP-10111</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>\u00b7 $2.70 \u00b7 Link to product \u00b7 $14.00 \u00b7 Link to breakout board</p> Pros Cons Breakout board, so foot footprint is small on pcb Needs the breakout board; otherwise, soldering is too hard <ol> <li>PSD0401120</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>\u00b7 $6.78 \u00b7 Link to product</p> Pros Cons Small footprint Soldering is harder cause it's small Good documentation"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#power-supply","title":"Power Supply","text":"<ol> <li>Same Sky PJ-102AH</li> </ol> <p>\u00b7 $0.76 \u00b7 Link to product</p> Pros Cons Readily available with the kit provided by the class EGR 304 A third pin that is not useful for the PCB being created, so it's just an extra drill hole in the PCB Works with 2mm power jack plugs ins 24 VDC output, 5Amp <ol> <li>Same Sky PJ-002B</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>\u00b7 $0.52 \u00b7 Link to product</p> Pros Cons Outputs 24 Vdc 2.5 amp A third pin that is not useful for the PCB being created, so it's just an extra drill hole in the PCB Costs less then than the previous option Uses a 2.5mm jack <ol> <li>Tensility International Corp 54-00127</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>\u00b7 $0.76 \u00b7 Link to product</p> Pros Cons Outputs 48 Vdc 6 amp A third pin that is not useful for the PCB being created, so it's just an extra drill hole in the PCB Costs the same as the first option Uses a 5.5mm jack"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#choice-same-sky-pj-102ah","title":"Choice: Same Sky PJ-102AH","text":"<p>Rationale: The J-102AH is the chosen option for a few simple reasons.
