## Overview
This block diagram is a basic overveiw of the connection needed for my subsystem. It works as a clearly visualization of what is on the board then just the raw PCB.

My subsystem includes a sesnor, along with a pic microcontroller for I2c comunication. Along side that, it is powered by a dc wall power supply that is rated for 12 volts, that is then lowered to 3.3v with a switching regulator. Lastly, there is a uart connection to a esp 32 for wifi transmissions.
